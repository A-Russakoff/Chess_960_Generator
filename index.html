        This is a demonstration of HTML5, CSS, & JavaScript. 
        It features a non-trivial JavaScript application and 
        utilizes some of the following features:<br><br>
        Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Syntax.<br>
        Mode 'use strict' in JavaScript.<br>
        Linking between .html, .css, and .js files.<br>
        Elementary styling with CSS.<br>
        Basic functions in JavaScript.<br>
        Buttons and event handlers.<br>
        Use of HTML5 Canvas with javascript.<br>
        Loading an array of .jpg and .png images,
        waiting for the image array to load before enabling 
        the program's draw features.(This was tricky and interesting, 
        and I'm certain I will change the implementation
        in the near future.)<br>
        <br>
        Some more information about the application:<br
        ><br>
        In broad strokes, the application generates a new position by generating 
        5 random numbers.<br> 
        <br>
        1/4 for the Light-Squared Bishop. <br>
        1/4 for the Dark-Squared Bishop. <br>
        1/6 for the Queen.<br>
        1/5 for one of the Knights &<br>
        1/4 for the other.<br>
        <br>
        The Rooks and King are then placed sequentially, first Rook, then King, 
        then Rook, in the remaining three squares. <br>
        <br>
        Positions are stored in a simple linear array.
        A function is required that is designed to ignore positions that have
        already been used as it searches for the square that corresponds to
        the random number used to place the piece. 
        Once the board-position is generated, a simple 'switch case' object is used
        to draw the pieces on the canvas to the correct squares. The individual
        positions (squares) of the black and white pieces are always mirror 
        images of each other, so once we have the board-position for one color, we
        get the other for free. The application simply paints the pieces
        over the background image (the board) in pairs with the a corresponding
        offset. <br>
        <br>
        Currently the JavaScript application is roughly 150 lines of code, including 
        handling all of the graphic objects and the event handlers for the buttons.<br>
        <br>
        Thoughts:<br>
        <br>
        This is my first attempt at creating an application for an HTML page. I 
        am confident I have made some very strange or unconventional code 
        decisions, and that I'm misusing and abusing terminology related to 
        the languages used here. That being said, I feel as though I learned
        a lot about how these lanuages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) link together,
        and what their individual intended functions are.   <br>
        <br>

        To-Do:<br>
        -re-implement change theme buttons<br>
        -attach graphics to linked public domain graphics<br>
